This project demonstrates how to use Sphinx in order to generate documentation.
The documentation can be generated in the form of HTML or, using LaTeX, in the
form of a PDF. The project should compile in our labs or in any Ubuntu
installation with the packages `python3` and `python3-sphinx`.

Structure
=========
The `cmake/` directory contains modules for detecting whether sphinx or make
are present on the system.

The `docs/` directory contains the data and configuration files for sphinx
along with a CMakeLists.txt that will generate documentation based on the
data and configuration files.

The contents of documentation are stored in reST, or reStructured Text, files.
The main reST file is called `index.rst`. This file contains a list of all
other reST files that need to be examined in order to build the documentation.
reST is a markup format similar to Markdown or HTML. You can read more about
the features of reST at http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html, although you do not
need to understand or use these features for the project documentation.

Basic configuration of the project is stored in `conf.py`. This includes such
information as the name of the project, the names of the authors, and extra
information for formatting the documentation.

Building Documentation
======================
If python3 and sphinx are installed, then configuring with cmake and building
with make will generate a `docs/` subdirectory of the build directory. The
`html/` subdirectory contains the generated HTML documentation. If LaTeX is
also detected on the building machine, then a file called `manual.pdf` will
be generated and copied into the `html/` subdirecory.

You can examine the provided reST files in this example project to see the
basic reST files that may be useful for providing user documentation.
